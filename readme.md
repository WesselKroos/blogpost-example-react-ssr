This is the complete solution regarding a blogpost I made for TrueLime. You can view the blogpost here: http://blogs.truelime.nl

## Development
Install required packages, start the server, start the development build and watch the client-side code for changes:
`yarn start`

## Production
1. Install
`yarn install`
2. Build to production:
`yarn build`
3. Start the server:
`yarn start-server`
